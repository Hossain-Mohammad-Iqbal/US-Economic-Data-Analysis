# US-Economic-Data-Analysis
This project aims to extract some essential economic indicators from historical datasets of GDP &amp; Unemployment rate in USA over the years. After analysis we will display these economic indicators in a Dashboard.

Note: To view the interactive features of the notebook, such as custom JavaScript plots and maps we will have to use nbviewer(https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Because when we add Jupyter Notebook or IPython Notebook files with a .ipynb extension on GitHub, they will render as static HTML files in the github repository. So, in short, interactive features of Jupyter notebooks like the folium maps won't be rendered when it is added.

So let's put the github link of this notebook in nbviewer and all the maps will be rendered there as they would normally be in a jupyter notebook.
